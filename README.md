# AP-Net

AP-Net is a python package for modeling intermolecular interactions with atomic-pairwise neural networks.
The AP-Net architecture provides smooth and asymptotically correct interaction potentials.
The features of this python package include:
* Predict SAPT interaction energies with a pre-trained model
* Predict atomic charge distributions with a pre-trained model
* Train your own interaction energy or atomic property model
